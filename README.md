This repository contains solutions to some academic exercises.

The solutions may not be perfect, e.g. many classes are missing constructors. This is because some solutions are based on ready-made prepared templates and some solutions are written around a specific skill.

<b>Don't rely</b> too much on this repo, I just worked on it a bit so I decided to post it here.
