<h2>ðŸš§ Translation In Progress ðŸš§</h2>
<p  style="white-space: pre-line;">This repository was written in Polish by default (I know it's bad practice but such were the requirements). I am currently working on translating it into English.

The solutions may not be perfect, e.g. many classes are missing constructors, but the tasks were aimed at testing a specific skill so they were written around that skill.

Don't rely too much on this repo, I just worked on it a bit so I decided to post it here.
